<h3>Welcome to FuzzLabs</h3>

FuzzLabs in a modular fuzzing framework, written in Python. It uses a modified version of the amazing Sulley fuzzing framework (Sulley on Github) as the core fuzzing engine.<br><br>

Some of the key features:<br><br>

    <ul class="help_menu">
        <li>Modular architecture</li>
        <li>Support for multiple fuzzing jobs at the same time</li>
        <li>Capability of fuzzing applications over different transport mediaâ€™s (Network, File, Bluetooth)</li>
        <li>Possibility to add your own transport media handlers easily (e.g. USB)</li>
        <li>Web interface supporting multiple engine connections for management</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Installation</h3>
<h4>Basic Setup</h4>

To start using FuzzLabs, first you have to clone the repository. Once that is done, execute the dev_setup.sh script in &lt;FUZZLABS_HOME&gt;. This script will install packages FuzzLabs depends on and, additional tools for development and debugging.<br><br>

An additional step that might have to be done is to create the directories "queue" and "archived" under &lt;FUZZLABS_HOME&gt;/jobs/ if they are not there. The queue directory is where the jobs get picked up from. The archived directory contains jobs that has been finished or stopped for whatever reason.<br><br>

The FuzzLabs engine can be started by issuing the following command:<br><br>

<pre>
<FUZZLABS_HOME>/fuzzlabs.py start
</pre>

The engine can be shut down with the following command:<br><br>

<pre>
<FUZZLABS_HOME>/fuzzlabs.py stop
</pre>
<br>

<h4>Web Server Setup</h4>

FuzzLabs has a web interface where you can manage your jobs and the engines as well. For this interface to be accessible you will obviously need a web server, which is basically the only thing not getting installed by the setup script. This is because you can use basically any web server you like to host the Web GUI. As the GUI is only HTML5 and JavaScript you don't need support for any dynamic languages (such as PHP). If you just do a <b>sudo apt-get install nginx</b> you got the web server covered. <br><br>

The web server does not have to be on the same machine as the engine, but split-deployments will be discussed later. In this install guide we will be doing a deployment where all the components are on a single server.<br><br>

The next step is to modify your web server's configuration to use <FUZZLABS_HOME>/www as the document root. For example, in case of Nginx the following simple configuration will suffice:<br><br>

<pre>
server {
    listen   80;
    root /srv/FuzzLabs/www;
    index index.html;
    server_name localhost;
    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
    }
}
</pre>

Once the configuration is set up, restart the web server. Then, open the GUI. With the configuration above, the URL would be simply: <b>http://127.0.0.1/</b><br><br>
At this point you should see the GUI displaying a form to add your first engine.<br><br>

<h4>Engine Setup on the GUI</h4>

The last step of the setup process is to configure your first engine using the web interface. This you can do on the initial form which is displayed when you visit the GUI and there is no engine registered.<br><br>

You have to provide the following details:<br><br>

    <ul>
        <li>Engine name: This can be anything you'd like and only used to help you identify and distinguish your engines.</li>
        <li>Address: The IP address or host name of the engine.</li>
        <li>Port: The port number the engine is listening on. By default this is 26000.</li>
        <li>Password: If the engine is protected by a password, you have to specify the password here. By default, no password is used.</li>
    </ul>

There are some restrictions for some of the fields. You can read about each of these by moving your mouse over the help button next to each input field.
Once you have added your first engine, you are ready to use the web interface.<br><br>
Please note that all engine related data are stored in the web browser's local storage. If you clear out the local storage, all these settings are lost.
